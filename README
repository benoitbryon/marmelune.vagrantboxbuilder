Automate the creation of `Vagrant base boxes`_.

.. warning:: This work is experimental.


*********
Resources
*********

* `Code repository`_
* `Bugtracker`_


*****
Usage
*****

* Install `VirtualBox`_ and `Vagrant`_.
* Install vagrantboxbuilder. As an example with
  ``pip install git+https://github.com/benoitbryon/vagrantboxbuilder.git``
* You got a ``vagrantboxbuilder`` command.
* Get or create an operating system ISO which installs Vagrant requirements. As
  an example, you can use `debisogen`_'s and its `preseed file for Vagrant`_.
* Or see ``vagrantboxbuilder --help`` for usage.
* Run
  ``vagrantboxbuilder --iso=path/to/installer.iso --vagrant-box=path/to/output.box``
* You got a .box file.


*****************
How does it work?
*****************

Vagrantboxbuilder...

* creates a temporary virtual machine in VirtualBox.
* boots the VM on the iso file.
* waits for the installation to finish (user interaction required). The
  installation is "finished" when Vagrant stuff is installed on the machine and
  the machine is shutdown.
* packages the box.
* destroys the temporary VM from VirtualBox.

Customization of the VM for Vagrant is supposed to be fully performed during
OS installation, i.e. the ISO file contains it all! That's why we suggest
tools like `debisogen`_ to get the ISO.
